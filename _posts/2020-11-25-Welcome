Hi there. This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts on what's interesting me currently. I am a Ph.D. student in EECS at UC Berkeley, and most of my recent thoughts revolve around 1) game theory and the relevance of economic ideas in developing a modern theory of AI 2) control of dynamical systems that exhibit complicated behavior, especially through subsystem interactions and 3) the philosophy -> economics -> computing value chain.
