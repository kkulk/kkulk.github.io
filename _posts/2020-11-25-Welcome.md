Hi there. This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts on what's interesting me currently. I am a Ph.D. student in EECS at UC Berkeley, and most of my recent thoughts revolve around:

1) Game theory and the relevance of economic ideas in developing a modern theory of AI 
2) Control of dynamical systems that exhibit complicated behavior, especially through subsystem interactions
3) The philosophy -> economics -> computing value chain. 

I'll be posting some expository notes, but mainly will be writing on technical topics that have been interesting me. Hope you find something interesting on here! Feel free to reach out at <ksk@eecs.berkeley.edu> if something catches your eye.
