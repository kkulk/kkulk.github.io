title: Differentiation on Euclidean Spaces 
---

This post covers the theory of Hardy-Littlewood maximal functions. The core idea here is: can we extend basic notions that surround the fundamental theorem of calculus to higher dimensional Euclidean spaces? Some prerequisites for this post include: the construction of Lebesgue measure, and the formal statement of the Radon-Nikodym theorem for one-dimensional Euclidean space ($$\mathbb{R}$$).
