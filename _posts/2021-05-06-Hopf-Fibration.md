title: The Hopf Fibration

### This post is based on John Lee's "Introduction to Smooth Manifolds" and lectures by Prof. Richard Bamler at UC Berkeley. 

The action of the sphere $$S^1$$ on the higher dimensional sphere $$S^{2n+1}$$ is one of the most profound objects in differential geometry. We study the consequences of this action here.
