title: Distractions in Science - An Academic's Review of "Indistractable" 
---

Why didn't productivity tools rapidly accelerate mathematical and scientific research? 

This image is a plot of the Gamma function from Jahnke and Emde's 1933 book. This book was written without any computing tools, much less high-performance graphics libraries, programmming languages, and scientific computing experts, and contains detailed plots and computations of functions and curves. The figures are drawn by expert draughtsmen - to scale. One can only imagine the hours of work that each plot took.  

Throughout much of scientific history, it has been a tedious task to run calculations to study hypotheses. Today, we have algorithmized much of scientific computation. We have  turned difficult machine learning calculations into matrix-vector multiplications, to the point that Google calls its high-performance chips "Tensor Processing Units", harking back to the famous multilinear maps from the minds of Gauss, Riemann, and Levi-Civita. In short, mathematics and science have never had access to more leverage with which to test theories. The functions that Jahnke and Emde wrote their book on can be plotted instantaneously in Wolfram Alpha. 

I read Nir Eyal's book "Indistractable" with a view towards this question: Can we focus our attention and tools in a way that enables rapid progress in scientific research? This question is dear to me because I live in two worlds: one of mathematical serenity and scientific reason, and another bustling with activity and distractions. 

Mathematical work is particularly interesting because it requires constantly beating up against a seemingly impenetrable wall. Eventually, after enough persistence, the wall breaks and a theorem shines through. Science is also like this. Attention to detail and granular focus are almost table stakes. 

And yet, despite tools that were unavailable to our ancestors, we are unable to pay attention at the levels required in science without being distracted. I find myself routinely unable to focus on a single problem as long as is necessary to solve it. 

Eyal provides a framework with which to think about this problem. The first insight is that the tools are not the issue (or in Eyal's words, Luddism is not the answer). Instead, it is the cobweb of internal and external triggers that leads us from traction to distraction. Eyal makes sure to point out that removing distractions does not mean incessantly focusing, or even working. Instead, it is taking actions that move us towards goals as we have set them internally. Triggers are the mechanisms that drive us to either pursue or not pursue our goals.
