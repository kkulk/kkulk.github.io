I am a second year Ph.D. student in the EECS Department at Berkeley, interested in control, learning, microeconomic theory, and all that we can do to make large-scale AI systems work better with humans. 

### More Information

I also like reading/writing about technology companies, history, and culture, especially the history of science.
